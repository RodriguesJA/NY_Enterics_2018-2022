# NY_Enterics_2018-2022
Collaborating with the Wadsworth Center of the Department of Health of New York State, we are evaluating the diversity of, and presence of AMR genes within foodborne pathogens isolated from patients pre-, during, and "post" the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., 2018 - 2023), with particular emphasis on _Escherichia coli_ and _Salmonella Enterica_.
